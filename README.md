Mentor Map
==========
MentorMap is something that can be utilized by people of differing age groups, whether it is someone struggling with high school algebra or grandma wanting to do a complicated cross stitch for needlework. A mentor is someone who you can rely on with their professional expertise, who can make achieving your goals easier. Our app will connect you with an expert in your trade, locally, in-person or virtually. Additionally, with your mentor, itâ€™ll be a great way to network with a local professional to either find a new career or friend.
